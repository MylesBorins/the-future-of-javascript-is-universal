## Abstract

The Node.js modules team has finally got there! With Node.js 12.x we shipped a new implementation to our EcmaScript Modules (ESM) implementation with plans to unflag by LTS. This talk will cover the history of ESM in Node.js, the iterations of the implementation, and catch you up as to how things currently work.

## A bit more info

This talk will cover content for Node.js application developers, Front End application developers, module authors, and anyone who is interested in how platform decisions get made.
 diverge; This is their story.
