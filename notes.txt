* The future of Universal JavaScript

  - what gets in the way?
    - platform specific flags / environment
  - some modules may be specific to an environment
  - issue with common.js, had to strip it all out to even get it workign in the browser
    - somewhat true about node.js apis as well
  - people wanted to use the new module standard because it is what the browser would use, but how they wrote it can never be run in the browser
  - for 5 years people thought modules existed, but they didn't actually
  - File paths can make things difficult
    - need to normalize between environments
    - absolute paths are not reconcilable
  - Where does the platform end?
    - Is this thing I'm writing part of the platform?
  - Streams!
  - Standards to king make vs grassroots to gain ecosystem adoption
    - E_TOO_MANY_VENDORS
      - TC39
      - W3C (many different groups)
      - WHATWG
      - IEFT
      - IANA
  - Good examples of existing "standard" universal modules
    - console
    - URL
    - 
  - where do namespaces fit in?
  - The future of JSON Modules (and other such module e.g. css / html / wasm)
  - types of tooling
    - do more by doing less
    - begining to create a nihilistic view of the future
    - should be progressive
  - where do built ins fit in this?
